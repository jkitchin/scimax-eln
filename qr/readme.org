Some tricky things in a notebook are recording what reagents you used in an experiment. Ideally, you would record things like the batch number of a chemical, in case you later discover it was contaminated, so you can identify affected experiments.

Some reagents are made, e.g. stock solutions. You might label that solution, and reference the label. Naming things is hard though, and an ELN does not have "page numbers" exactly.

Here we explore using completion, an inventory, UUIDs and QR codes to make tracking this information easier.
